'''
Components of the shot:
d       --> pbp-esq discription (Made 19ft jumper 11:44 in 1st Qtr."
id      --> the shot id (gameID+xxxxx)
made    --> T/F
p       --> player shooting (same as pbp name)
pid     --> player ID (super usefull)
qtr     --> quarter (what does OT look like??)
t       --> ?? values: a, h,
x       --> x-cord where shot was taken from
y       --> y-cord where shot was taken from

I'm assuming this holds (from basketballgeek.com/data)
How do I interpret the (x,y) shot location coordinates?:
If you are standing behind the offensive teamâ€™s hoop then
the X axis runs from left to right and the Y axis runs from
bottom to top. The center of the hoop is located at (25, 5.25).
x=25 y=-2 and x=25 y=96 are free-throws (8ft jumpers)
